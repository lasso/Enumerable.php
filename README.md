# lasso/enumerable

IMPORTANT NOTICE: This package is INCOMPLETE. I'm giving a talk in a few weeks (2016-10-17) and this package will be showcased at that time. Hold on, we're getting there!

Inspired by ruby's Enumerable module, this library allows you to create enumerables in PHP.

## Install dependencies
`composer install`

## Run tests
`vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php tests`
